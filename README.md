# BuildBuddy RBE Toolchain

Currently supports Linux C/C++ (including CGO) & Java builds on Ubuntu 16.04 or Ubuntu 20.04.

## Usage instructions

For the most up-to-date instructions, see our [Official Documentation](https://buildbuddy.io/docs/rbe-setup).

#### BzlMod

Add the following to your `MODULE.bazel` file:

```python
bazel_dep(name = "toolchains_buildbuddy")

# Use the extension to create toolchain and platform targets
buildbuddy = use_extension("@buildbuddy//:extensions.bzl", "buildbuddy")
```

The execution platforms and CC toolchains should be registered automatically under BzlMod.

For a more detailed example and customization options, see our [BzlMod Example](https://github.com/buildbuddy-io/buildbuddy-toolchain/tree/master/examples/bzlmod).

#### WORKSPACE

Add the following lines to your `WORKSPACE` file. You'll probably want to pin your version to a specific commit rather than master.

```python
http_archive(
    name = "io_buildbuddy_buildbuddy_toolchain",
    sha256 = "e899f235b36cb901b678bd6f55c1229df23fcbc7921ac7a3585d29bff2bf9cfd",
    strip_prefix = "buildbuddy-toolchain-fd351ca8f152d66fc97f9d98009e0ae000854e8f",
    urls = ["https://github.com/buildbuddy-io/buildbuddy-toolchain/archive/fd351ca8f152d66fc97f9d98009e0ae000854e8f.tar.gz"],
)

load("@io_buildbuddy_buildbuddy_toolchain//:deps.bzl", "buildbuddy_deps")

buildbuddy_deps()

load("@io_buildbuddy_buildbuddy_toolchain//:rules.bzl", "buildbuddy")

buildbuddy(name = "buildbuddy_toolchain")
```

Now you can use the toolchain in your BuildBuddy RBE builds. For example:

```
bazel build server \
    --remote_executor=remote.buildbuddy.io \
    --extra_toolchains=@buildbuddy_toolchain//:ubuntu_cc_toolchain \
    --extra_execution_platforms=@buildbuddy_toolchain//:platform_linux_x86_64 \
    --platforms=@buildbuddy_toolchain//:platform_linux_x86_64
```

## Java support

Bazel provides support for Java toolchains out of the box.
You can enabled the Java toolchain with the following flags:

```
--java_language_version=17
--tool_java_language_version=17
--java_runtime_version=remotejdk_17
--tool_java_runtime_version=remotejdk_17
```

Available verions are listed in [Bazel's User Manual](https://bazel.build/docs/user-manual#java-language-version)

If you need a custom Java toolchain, see Bazel's docs on [Java toolchain configuration](https://bazel.build/docs/bazel-and-java#config-java-toolchains).

## Linux image variants

The following Linux images are available for remote execution:

### Ubuntu 16.04 image (**default**)

This image is the default when using the BuildBuddy toolchain. To
reference it explicitly, you can declare the toolchain like this:

```python
load("@io_buildbuddy_buildbuddy_toolchain//:rules.bzl", "buildbuddy", "UBUNTU16_04_IMAGE")

buildbuddy(name = "buildbuddy_toolchain", container_image = UBUNTU16_04_IMAGE)
```

This image includes the following build tools:

- Java 8 (javac 1.8.0_242)
- GCC 5.4.0
- GLIBC 2.23
- Clang/LLVM 11.0.0
- Python 2.7.12 (`python` in `$PATH` uses this version)
- Python 3.6.10
- Go 1.14.1

### Ubuntu 20.04 image

To use Ubuntu 20.04, import the toolchain as follows:

```python
load("@io_buildbuddy_buildbuddy_toolchain//:rules.bzl", "buildbuddy", "UBUNTU20_04_IMAGE")

buildbuddy(name = "buildbuddy_toolchain", container_image = UBUNTU20_04_IMAGE)
```

This image includes the following build tools:

- Java 11.0.17
- GCC 9.4.0
- GLIBC 2.31
- Clang/LLVM 15.0.0
- Python 2.7.18 (`python` in `$PATH` uses this version)
- Python 3.8.10
- Go 1.19.4

## Networking

If you need networking, you must enable it for the actions that need it. There
is a performance hit when networking is enabled because networking resources
need to be setup and torn down for each action. Because of the performance hit,
you probably want to enable networking just for the actions that need it by
adding the following exec_properties:

```
+    exec_properties = {
+        "dockerNetwork":"bridge",
+    },
```
